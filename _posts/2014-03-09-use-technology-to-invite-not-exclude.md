I saw this at a Safeway recently. The railing is on a raised planting area where lot of homeless and vagabond-type folks were sitting and idling. I guess the management decided that they didn\'t want the undesirables. I do not have a before-pic, but basically it was bunch of random people sitting there - including homeless.

###Use your super powers for good, not for evil

I find it sad that people lose sight of the humanity in others.

Even in less overt ways, this happens all the time, where we treat other human beings with little less respect than they deserve. And the tragedy is that we do so unwittingly.

Then again,it is sometimes hard to love oneself. Maybe that is where the problem starts. We deal with so many disappointments, headaches, heartaches, that it is hard to stay present and love oneself.

###World reimagined

The same problem re-imagined.
