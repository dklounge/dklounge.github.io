I wrote a post for the [product management community](http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/) reflecting on [competence and mastery](http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/blog/what-is-world-class/). The main point is that good things take time to build, including some techniques you can use to gain quick competence.

What it taks to build mastery, to get truly good at something, may surprise you. Check out [the post](http://productmanagementfasttrack.com/blog/what-is-world-class/).
