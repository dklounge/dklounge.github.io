I recently saw a post on Quora of someone interested in attending a business school MBA program. The user asked "[Are the content and concepts learned at a top MBA school valuable](http://www.quora.com/Business-School-Are-the-content-and-concepts-learned-at-a-top-MBA-school-valuable-in-the-real-world-or-is-the-degree-essentially-a-great-networking-tool-for-future-job-placement) in the real world or is the degree essentially a great networking tool for future job placement?"

Many of us who went to business school had a similar question on our minds. Looking back, it occurs to me that the best prospective students __would NOT__ have shared this question. I had it; I was not the best.

###What people want
Let\'s deconstruct this question. The user wants to know what the ROI on MBA education is going to be with respect to jobs. What the user really wants is a job. _Can it get me the job?_.

The user is aware of some baseline values - there is value to the network, and there is value to the 'insider' business information one can gain from studies.

###What people think is the truth
One of the Quora responses to the question included "At the best schools, an MBA = pre-qualification for the best jobs. Everything else is just icing on the cake."

Before going to Darden Business School, I read a book by the author Broughton, called
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/014311543X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=014311543X&linkCode=as2&tag=pmft-20">Ahead of the Curve: Two Years at Harvard Business School</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=pmft-20&l=as2&o=1&a=014311543X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

Being a non-business background professional, Broughton valued understanding how businesses worked and gaining confidence. That said, he was already an expert at writing, an author, so this added to his expertise. This is a good book to read, but is more interesting as a story than as an aswer to the Quora user\'s question.

###Advice for prospective students
Funny thing about learning. You can\'t learn how to fly a helicopter Matrix style - "Tank, I need a pilot program ... zoooop! I can fly!"

I took classes across various disciplines: finance, operations, decision analysis, marketing, communications, leadership. You dabble in one subject, and then move onto the next. You are training to be a multi-tasker, a master of none. And it is institutionalized and set into the very fabric of the MBA curriculum. First year requirements are, well, required.

What if you could be bold and just focus on one businss subject and forget the rest?

I wish I had done that. After all, when you join that company and take a job, you really just need to be good at one or two things. The rest, you learn along the way. I think most know this intuitively, but still feel MBA is a good stepping stone to further one\'s career.

What if you sat in one class all day instead of switching between four or five, and really juicing it? Talk to all of the professors on the subject matter. Form an informal club with others interested in the same thing as you are. Or, start a business while in business school. Would it be ironic to do that?

Mostly, we don\'t learn by osmosis. We learn something by actively using our brain through deliberate training. We read words, we articulate what we read with others, creating new neural connections. We also learn using our mirror neurons. When someone else speaks or talks, we learn.

If you go to B-school with base knowledge in topic, say human capital growth, then you have an opportunity to use your time and the intellectual resources on campus (professors, colleagues, university research labs) to come out world class on that topic. In which case you are writing your own ticket. Alternatively, you can come out of B-school having simply attended classes and lectures with passing interest, dabbling in this and that, to which you really only devote a portion of your quarter or semester. Then, you'll be mediocre and networking or otherwise, it won\'t help much with your job placement.
