##Career Path

I suspect many people struggle with career path decisions today, because a __career path__ is not what it used to be. I googled “career path” and this came up.

__I laughed at this picture__.  Many still grow up with similar mental models: it is in the schools, in our work places, exchanged among friends.  The reality is, this picture is __plain wrong__.  Why?

>Oh, so you worked 10 years to be a senior manager of a socks manufacturer?  What?

>Your company closed doors and moved to China?  You can’t seem to find a buyer for your expert knowledge of socks inventory management or textile supply chain management?

>Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that!

Truth is, most people do fine, but it isn\'t because they are on a path or a track. That\'s a myth. Instead, most professionals will find ways to learn and gain focused set of skills that they can transfer to other companies and roles.

So, if you are not doing that, beware! You risk obsolescence. There is a career ladder, but it is more like the ladder that Littlefinger explains in HBO\'s <a target="out" href="http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones#/">Game of Thrones</a>.

If you want to navigate through this chaos, find your strengths and focus your career efforts around it.
