I am going to be moving my blogs and rants from [findinbay.blogspot.com](http://findinbay.blogspot.com).

Why re-start? Because I\'ve had many restarts in my life lately. It is about building new skills for the future. (Though, I am of the mind that [no one pays for skills](../no-one-pays-you-for-skills) per se.) It is about learning to create. And you do that by the practice of building, building little things like this blog, and writing.
