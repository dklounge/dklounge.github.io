[2014 Sochi Winter Olympics](http://www.sochi2014.com/en) are in full swing. I turned on the TV while visiting my parents in North Carolina.

The women\'s 500 meter long-track skating starts with two racers in their own lanes. The starting gun is preceded by dead silence and absolute freeze in motion. Each competitor has one false start to give. The second false start disqualifies.

The gun fires! Second shot is heard immediately after. There is a false start by a German competitor. Now everyone is nervous. The competitors return to the start line.

The gun fires! Yet again, the second shot is heard immediately after the first shot. Another false start. I can not yet see who is at fault, but the German competitor glides with her hands on her face. She knows she is disqualified.

In the replay, I see that all it took was that her elbow flinched by an inch prior to the start. __This is tragic__. Four years of preparation. A flinch of an elbow.

__Are you prepared for everything but the start?__ If you are preparing for everything but the beginning, you may never get to show off your talents or [skills](../no-one-pays-you-for-skills).
