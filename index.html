  <h1>The Growth Blog</h1>
  <p>I write about self-exploration, entrepreneurship, and growth - whenever I feel like it - but generally weekly. It's for entreprenurs, cracker jacks, people who like cats, and for people looking to grow.</p>

  <h3>Stuff ... really</h3>

  <div class="blog">
    <p>I'll be working hard to figure out useful content for you during the year of 2014. For now, enjoy reading <a href="{{ site.posts[0].url }}">{{site.posts[0].title}}</a> and other <a href="{{BASE_PATH}}/pages/blog.html">blog posts</a>.
    </p>

    <p>During March, I'm working on a series of posts on <strong>meetup 101</strong>: what they are, and how you can use them. If you're interested in getting those, be sure to subscribe to the blog via <a target="_" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DavidKimBlog">RSS</a> or get a copy by email when they are complete.
